My only issue about the base game is that good birds are harder to find making the engine seems lackluster and could bored of some player that wasn't into the theme or the mechanic that much in the first place.",
        "Fun, zen game.<br />Lots of replayability as you will only see a small portion of all the bird cards per game. Which to me is also a downside. It's an engine builder, but sometimes you just don't get the right cards to, and often when you do it's already late in the game.<br /><br />Great theme",

Every month feels almost the same and gathering a set of cards is not a mechanic which me and my friends are fans of. It is still much better than regular Pandemic.",
