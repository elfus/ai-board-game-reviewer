                "Great space opera, heavily focus on space combat/fleet build-ups and direct conflits than diplomacy/strategizing. Great alternative to heavier game in the genre as Twilight Imperium. Some player complains randomness in surrounding starting tiles can be deadly, I don't mind. Still fun until the end.",
