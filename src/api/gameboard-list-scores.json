                "Kurz: \"Brass: Birmingham\" ist ein interaktives Netzwerk-/Aufbauspiel mit interessanter Markt-Mechanik. In etwa der Hälfte des Spiels wird der Großteil der gebauten Dinge wieder abgeräumt. Das bringt Spannung mit. Ich find es gut, sehe es aber NICHT als eines der allerbesten Spiele an.<br /><br />Langform:<br />Wir haben hier ein solides Spiel, bei dem ich verstehen kann, warum es den Leuten gefällt. Aber das beste Brettspiel? Ich glaube diese Leute haben z.B. noch kein \"Food Chain Magnate\" oder \"Mombasa\" gespielt.<br />Es gibt 2 Zeitalter die einerseits dafür sorgen, das man überlegen muss, was man wann baut und andererseits das man ggf. beim bauen blockiert wird.<br />Die Zeitalter, das es jeden \"BauOrt\" nur einmal gibt und das man die Rohstoffe der Anderen auch nutzen darf, machen das Spiel sehr interaktiv,  (\"Euro-Games sind ja üblicherweise eher Multiplayer-Solitär). Dieser hohe Grad an Interaktion kann aber auch anstrengend sein.<br />Außerdem verleitet dieser Mix zu Analysis-Paralysis.<br />Da jeder Gebäude-Platz nur 1x besteht, entsteht ein Wettstreit um Diese und den Verbindungen dazwischen.<br /><br />-es gibt eine gewisse Lernkurve<br />-es gibt mehrere Wege zum Ziel, scheinbar aber auch welche die etwas besser sind<br />-Die Kanal- und BahnÄra scheinen auch geschichtlich gut zu passen.<br />-interessanter Markt-Mechanismus<br /><br />\"Brass: Birmingham\" unterscheidet sich mit \"Brass: Lancashire\" (vor langer Zeit als \"Kohle\" erschienen) u.A. durch das Bier und die speziellen Märkte. Man könnte es als erweiterte Edition zu Lanceshire/\"Kohle\" sehen.<br />-&gt; \"Kohle\" sah übrigens überhaupt nicht ansprechend aus. Beide \"Brass\"-Editionen dagegen sehr.<br /><br />Unbedingt nochmal, aber nicht für meine eigene Sammlung.<br /><br /><br />(Ursprungs-Kommentar aus 02/2024:<br />Eine abgebrochene Partie, daher keine Bewertung.(nach erstem Zeitalter)<br />Es blieb mir im Gedächtnis, das es sehr interaktiv (fast schon aggressiv) ist.

                "My first Legacy type game.<br />I liked this way of telling a story that evolves as the games progress. The rules are quite simple at the beginning of the game, but become numerous at the end of the game; and it is very easy to forget some of them unintentionally.<br />To win the last month, you only need luck.<br />Very good times spent! I recommend it for those who haven't played it yet (Be careful, it will certainly bring back memories of Covid XD)",

Games like Pillars of Eternity, Mass Effect, or the new Baldur's Gate 3 give me everything I like about Gloomhaven, including co-op in any CRPG, but with better story and characters, less bookkeeping, and WAY better setup time. When I see this game ranked this high on BGG, I genuinely assume that the people rating it just don’t play RPG videogames. Even the Steam digital version of Gloomhaven blows playing in paper out of the water.

I am addicted to this game! 50h+ in first 2 months!<br />I have a solo 2-character game and a 2-player 4-character game (online coop) going on at the same time. We also started a 4-player game and I am set to start another game with 2 players online. I have played the game at easy and sometimes I had a hard time collecting all the gold. Then I tried normal difficulty and we are just having trouble surviving! All 5 games at normal difficulty have ended up with us winning in the last 1-2 rounds before we would have lost. The card play and progression between missions is fantastic. Real headache (the good one) for deciding what items to buy, which enhancements/perks/cards to get.<br />I know I would never play the physical game because of setup time, upkeep and difficulty of gathering interested players often enough. The digital version solves all those problems for me.<br /><br />April 2021 update:<br />Still just fantastic. We have a group of 4 people who play online every Friday night since September 2020. We win most scenarios (95%) at normal difficulty, and rather rarely on the last 1-2 turns. We could increase difficulty to hard if we want more of a challenge but the game is still fun to play at normal. I played solo a bit with new characters after raising my 2-character party to level 9, but I am not that interested in it anymore (and I don't have much time). Playing multiplayer online is just so much more satisfying.<br /><br />January 2022 update:<br />We had not played since June because some of us had started to meet in person and we wanted a break after all those plays. We started the real campaign in November (now that it's available), and with COVID lockdown through the winter we are now back to playing 2 scenarios every week.

On one hand the game really is just draw until you find a win-con, on the hand theres a sort jazz-improv approaching to forming an engine to this game.  That ponzi scheme zoo i won with?:  it started as a European Fish zoo, had the sponsors for it an everything.  Then i didnt draw a single European animals the rest of the game, nor was there any in the display (think shop kinda).  I had to switch to trying win off of small animals, then small herbivores.  Again, on one hand i can attribute my win to 2-3 cards i just happened to draw, but also i drew A LOT and A LOT of it was just not usable for me.  That also said, a lot of the cards I passed up on were gaming winning in their own right.  It reminds of Slay the Spire in that i have no idea what I am going for at first, then i find something good, then I just spec into that hard and hope it works out, and frankly in this context I get why this game is so highly rated, BUT unlike Slay the Spire I cant play this game in under 1 hour XD AND much like Slay the Spire if you somehow dont lean into a strategy fast enough it can get bad, BUT you can in a very controlled manner buff the hell out of your draws (in burst, basically look up the action selection system, i like it a lot, and more cards played into it that i wouldve though).  So basically if you chill out and everyone is lax, the game is pretty fun, but if you want serious eurogaming or loooove 4x and refuse to settle for less this isnt for you.  <br /><br />I dont want to get into the gameplay too much because this game is on the line of being heavyweight, and my thoughts on the nature of this games strategy is long enough, so basically: action system your action cards are basically assigned a random slot/level/power (higher power=do more/better stuff with the card), Use a card and the lower slots level up and the card you use goes back to slot/level/power 1.  Again, i like this, theres a lot of decision space in this already, and again theres cards that mess with this a bit.   Also you can perma upgrade some of these cards.  The zoo itself has a Feast of Odin/Isle of Cats tile laying thing going on, as do scoring cards in addition to set collection.  End of game add conservation points from cards that have endgame scoring (i had like 3ish, and again i had way more sponsor cards than everyone else who had like 1 maybe 2 endgame scoring cards).  Based on your conservation points you get a target number (smaller is better for target number, and its written on the board).  Appeal (you get a lot of these, every animal you play gives appeal as do other cards) minus Target number = vp.  This took us like 45 seconds to calculate, one of my friends and I were stunned.  We had out calculators out, we were ready to spend 10 minutes calculating 8x different factors.  Nope, find target number, subtract that from appeal bingo bango done.  On one hand this is REALLY anticlimatic, but again, i chillaxed, because that calculation is craaaazy slick, i am honestly adding points for this.  Also because this game is too random, this game doesnt have a tight amount of actions/turns, and i like that in heavier games a lot.<br /><br />Quick opinion on expansion: its nice, nothing feels op, zero problem learning this first play.  I didnt realize for balance reasons it removes cards from the base game.  I have since shuffled all the cards into a pile (not a deck, pile).  Oops<br /><br />I have one solid issue with this game:  the icons on cards are EGREGIOUS.  50%-75% are to signify text THATS ALREADY ON THE CARD, text mind you, is concise and explains it perfecftly, the icons are ALL OVER THE CARD its bad and distracting XD.  With this many icons i genuinely think you need 4x quick references, not 1x<br /><br />So back to my predicament, this game is way too chill for its weight (i say its like 3 - 3.25 in weight imo).  Again, thats a good thing and a bad thing which is why this game is SO hard to rate for  me.  Its somewhere between an 8 and a 9  for me for sure, because, again, great game, but too random bullshit go.  I ll give a few extra points because for whatever reason this game is ALWAYS on sale.  I am sure this has popped up on prime days, nerdz days, and at time of writing i am sure it will go on a publisher wide sale two more times this year time of writing.  Its not even that expensive (i wish it was like $10 less on MSRP tbh).  8.75 is the score i can give that gives me the least amount of conflict.  <br /><br />10 - Perfect<br /> 9 - Perfect, but I wish it was a little more exciting, possibly missing an x-factor<br /> 8 - Pretty darn good, get it if you can afford it, maybe some gripes<br /> 7 - Pretty good, would recommend getting if it is on sale<br /> 6 - It's fine, maybe get if there's a heavy sale<br /> 5 - Little boring, the game is functional though, wouldnt recommend buying<br /> 4 - Is technically a game<br /> 3 - The so-bad-its-good movie of board games<br /> 2 - Somehow even worse<br /> 1 - Purely hypothetical, unimaginably bad",

                "Extremely replayable game. Terraforning mars + Castles of burgandy meets Zoo zycoon.",
                "The hype was real with this game. I rarely play solo games, so that's a pretty big deal. At the time of writing this, I've played Ark Nova 11 times in one week. Helps that I am on Christmas vacation, but I haven't played a game solo with this much fervor since Spirit Island. In fact, I think Ark Nova is the best game I've played since Spirit Island. Since I'm talking about the solo mode, I might as well just keep talking about it. It's super simple: take so many actions and then do a break phase. After so many actions, the game is just over. The ease of the solo mode reminds me a lot of Terraforming Mars. There are other comparisons to Terraforming Mars, which I'll address later. Like Spirit Island, there are a lot of ways to tweak the difficulty: start with 20, 10, or 0 appeal on any particular map. Then you have basically 3 different difficulties of maps: Map A (easy), Map 0 (medium), and Unique Maps 1-8 (hard). So, basically 9 levels of difficulty. You could also create other levels of difficulty by adjusting the appeal however you want.<br /><br />So, what is Ark Nova? Well, it's a tile laying game with many cards that are all unique, with various tags, and range in price fairly significantly. You try to compete for the best goals with your opponents. Additionally, you will get more money periodically throughout the game. Sounds like Terraforming Mars. Right? Well, yes. Though, it's a different game. Terraforming Mars is an engine building game, where players directly and indirectly interact with one another through actions and on a shared board. In Terraforming Mars, players manage 6 main resources and sometimes other resources as well. Ark Nova is different. Ark Nova has less player interaction (especially with the carebear variant), players place tiles on their own individual boards, and have less resources to manage. I think Terraforming Mars is nominally about building and leveraging the best resource engine. Terraforming Mars feels transactional. Ark Nova, by comparison, feels much more like a puzzle. The cards in Ark Nova typically aren't just \"pay money\" get resources. In Ark Nova, almost all the cards have requirements. Some of those are action requirements and some of those are personal board state requirements. In Terraforming Mars, actions are typically pay money get VP or resources. While you have to spend money wisely, it doesn't feel difficult. The action queue of what to use and upgrade in Ark Nova is an efficiency puzzle of its own. While many people compare these games, they feel different.<br /><br />It amazes me that a game that has taken disparate elements from various games: various things from Terraforming Mars, two track meetup from Rajas of the Ganges, and the action queue of Civilization New Dawn and it works. Not only does it work, it is amazing and it feels very different than many other games that I've played. If you like heavier euros, you need to play this game. Given BGG's preferences, I suspect this will end up in the BGG top 20 or higher. Well done Mathias Wigge!!<br /><br />Edit: After more games and more time playing it, I can say I dislike the money chits and the advanced boards don't feel balanced, unfortunately. This was listed as previously owned as I was trying to reduce my collection, so I sold it. That said, thoughts of the game kept coming back into my head and I decided to reacquire when the Marine Worlds expansion was released and I also printed the unique player power boards so maps could change between play but players could use the same maps for a better balanced game. Though, if both have the same objectives due to the map constraints, maybe luck will play more of a factor/be less interesting. I will likely report back at some point.",
                "Fun mechanisms, but it goes a bit long. The end game scoring is more confusing than it should be in my opinion. I like the engine building and set collection aspects of it along with the interesting action selection mechanism. Shared card market and claimable public goals with diminishing returns provide some interaction to what would otherwise be a solitaire game. I would probably choose Earth, Terraforming Mars, or Underwater Cities over this one on a heavier game night, but I'm happy to own it and it may grow on me over time.",

                "I will start by saying this is one of the most Epic feeling games you will play, ever. In a 6 player match, where everyone already knows how to play, it still took us 10 full hours to play and took over every inch of a 6 foot x 3.5 foot table. Ironically what makes it so epic is also it's biggest flaw because the complexity and investment of time and effort in coordinating an all day event to play this game is quite daunting. I have played both the 3rd edition and the 4th and I have to say that the improvements made in the 4th edition are phenomenal and greatly improved on some of the major flaws inherent in the 3rd edition. Notably the way the technology works has been streamlined and improved, the components and art have been ever so slightly improved, the functions of the strategy cards have been tweaked and balanced better, the political voting has been incorporated into a new agenda phase, the player boards are much improved and easier to understand and keep track of upgrades, and even the box is a better storage solution. Overall, every single flaw that plagued the 3rd edition has been tweaked, streamlined, and fixed for this far superior 4th edition, in my opinion. If I was to name any one aspect that I still think is a negative about this game it's that it can be difficult to come back if one player gets off to a bad start. It's possible to eliminate a player either completely or make them essentially irrelevant and still have hours of the game left to play which can take some of the enjoyment out for that player considering such a long game. This is a game that everyone in this hobby of board gaming has to at least experience once. If and when you do, take the time to do the leg work ahead of time by giving everyone rules, and materials ahead of time to prepare and plan out a full day with food and snacks.

Almost death by boredom, saved by a more heated finale.<br /><br />Overall I see the potential of this game but find it quite overrated. It's core mechanics are somewhat incongruent mumbo-jumbo of good and bad/very dated concepts. While strategies and command tokens are fun and rewarding concept, component actions mostly encourage stalling, tech tree is bland, agenda is poorly designed and fiddly and random draw objectives is just a bad concept. You never feel really in control, just constantly jockeying for goals that are thrust on you and do not feel very immersive.<br /><br />EDIT: After another play i am lowering the rating to 5.5. It just doesn't feel justified to spend 10 hours playing this when there aren't that many meaningful decisions and instead of playing space opera you are bogged down in negotiating weird deals with your neighbors where you \"borrow\" a planet from someone in order to get your objective (politely allowing them to get their ass off beforehand).

                "Wasn't sure about this one after something of a hyped launch back in 2016 and I don't rate the component quality, visual or physical, given the price point. But it hasn't fallen away in the interim.<br /><br />So we got it. And yep, it's good. More than good. <br /><br />What sets it apart seems to be, making choices on what projects you could do is cheap, but which projects you actually commit to requires work. This does two notable things, First it moves some of the analysis paralysis inherent to complex games into your downtime rather than your turn. So you can actually think a bit in the context of not feeling as much pressure of others waiting for you to act. Second it means you tend to not feel on any given turn that sense of turn stuckness endemic to games that path foresight learned from path dependent game knowledge elide [1]. You can always take on a new project or make incremental progress on one you have. And so, 'it will click on the fourth game', is not a problem Terraforming Mars presents its players or its teachers. Instead you'll get better at the game, rather than converge on a baseline adequacy needed to get better. Unsurprisingly—yet massively understated—these make the Terraforming Mars experience feel good. Quite good. From the point of view of player, and especially new player, engagement, that's a brilliant design achievement. Terraforming Mars deserves immense credit for opening up an expanse where newer gamers can access complexity with ease, and experienced gamers can access ease with complexity. <br /><br />----<br />[1] See also, the \"you can't possibly judge a game on its first play\" trope.<br /><br />2021",

The scale of this game and the story it tells are amazing. Yes, it has a significant luck factor and there's a ton of dice chucking, but War of the Ring somehow manages to make it fun. Everything just works as it's glued together by this fantastic theme - chaos and randomness are just a part of the narrative.   <br /><br />I've painted all the minis in their respective nation colours, added custom-made card holders and a black leather bag for the hunt tokens and upgraded all six-sided dice. It really facilitated and improved the whole gameplay. I've also painted the custom made 3D model of Mount Doom to further enhance the look of the board. <br /><br /><b>/update, March 2019:</b> Don't listen to people who say that this game is terrible with 4 players, we had a TOTAL BLAST playing it in teams. It's a different experience, but really wonderful - sharing all your highs and lows with a teammate is something you can't experience in a 2-player game. The only thing I'm not sure I like yet is the fact that one of the winning allies \"wins more\" - this may cause some weird \"semi-cooperative\" instances (\"my ally has more points so I will play selfishly to beat him, which may cost us the game\" type of a thing). We just split the victory 50/50 and it felt great. Still, rivalry within factions is an appropriate thematic touch so maybe the final scoring part will grow on me.<br /><br /><i>I own the following expansions: Lords of Middle-earth, Kings of Middle-earth, The Fate of Erebor, Treebeard mini-expansion, The Seeing Stones mini-expansion.</i>",

                "Pros:<br />-Tons of content and replayability<br />-Beautifully crafted systems that are simplistic once learned<br />-Immersive, fun, challenging gameplay<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Long set-up and play times<br />-Many difficult / nearly impossible missions<br />-Difficult to learn initially<br /><br />Jaws of the Lion is the perfect entrance to the Gloomhaven universe. It takes the time to set up and teach you the rules through several beginner missions, easing you into the complex world of Gloomhaven. The characters are all very unique and fun to play, bringing a drastically different flavor to the party. It does suffer from having long set-up and play times, and some of the missions are particularly tough, seeming almost like they weren't playtested enough. However, the satisfying, clever gameplay and customization you can put into your character keeps me coming back time and time again. This is a great legacy game for semi-experienced gamers to pick up and enjoy, but difficult to recommend to new gamers or anyone with analysis paralysis. The value you get for the price is well-worth it alone, and as long as you can commit to learning it and taking the time to set it up, Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is high on the list of games to dedicate a weekend to.",

                "Jaws of the Lion is a very confused game.  It wants to be an RPG game with character development and player agency, but it's actually a board game with limited choice, terrible characters that don't develop beyond getting skill cards and no agency in your actions.  It wants to be a computer game, but it's still a board game with all the limitations therein (players have to handle all NPC decision making and movement, small maps that are tactically limited, lots of tokens/pieces for each type of enemy).  <br /><br />If you're going to put that much effort into a table top game, play D&D or Pathfinder.  You'll have a better time with less effort and more options.  <br />OR if you hate the hassle of learning all the rules and handling all the tokens: play a computer game like Into The Breach or XCOM.  You'll have more enemies, bigger/better maps, more variability, while your odds won't be tied to simplistic mechanics like how many cards are in your attack deck.<br /><br />There are better games to play.",

At the start of the game, the communists have the advantage, but the longer the game goes, the more the capitalists take hold and grow in power. Fascinating game.",

                "Amazing game. Strikes the perfect balance between tactics and strategy. Your cards help your opponent (which is genius btw) so you have to know the perfect time to play them to incur the least amount of damage, but unlike games like 7 Wonders and Terraforming Mars where you have to go with the flow and make the best of your situation, the scope of this game, the scoring cards, and a lot of other mechanics create a great strategic element which only increases the more you play. The small size of the deck(s) means it's possible to count cards which creates great situations where both players can tell what cards their opponents are holding and try to counter what they think they're going to do. The game really gets better every time you play it. 100% play this right now unless you have high blood pressure or some kind of stress related condition because this game is f**king TENSE.",

                "I've played this game well over 100 times through the app, it's a great implementation and an easy way to play a game that I've never even seen in person. The game really rewards tactical play around the card market and events, but also long term strategic play. The score track is almost a trick because in the majority of the games I've played the eventual winner was losing half way through the game.<br /><br />The expansion is fantastic because the leaders and wonders are now randomized to pick among the new and old ones, so every game is much more fresh because you are forced to explore new strategies.",

All these interact in various ways and a it's complicated enough that managing it all is pretty interesting.  The theme comes through somewhat, although maybe not as much as I'd like, and it is fun building your civilization from antiquity through to modern times.  Although I can't help but feel like you're really doing the same stuff throughout the whole game- the numbers on the cards just get bigger.  And this is a really long game- with inexperienced players this is an all day epic.  The military deck, and the military aspect in general, is nasty but makes the game much more interesting and tense, otherwise this is multiplayer solitare.  A solid civ game and that's no small feat.  But my search continues for one I really like.",

Getting all the parts of your engine running is tough, and you have to work with what the card market presents to you. This creates an engaging pressure that means you have to make every move with intent and keep looking over your shoulders. The expressiveness of the design without any map is impreesive.<br /><br />I’ve only played this digitally though I am keen to try it on the table at least once. I can see the fiddly nature of the physical game just by playing the digital version, but I think with enough experience already gained that it’s likely fairly manageable.",
                "Really good on the App-store version, but this does not work with other people. <br />The mechanics are so well done, but when it takes 5 minutes between your turns there is something that needs fixing. Also when the what the other players turn does not affect you much.<br />If you start falling behind it is a bonus for the others ahead to attack you, so you fall further behind.

                "3 Players",
                "This is a card driven civilization game where players use a limited supply of action tokens to take cards and add them to their tableaus or spend them on cards in their tableaus to activate those cards. What you are essentially doing is trying to move your markers up on various tracks in relationship to other players. Then event cards reward you or punish you for your relative position. The most crucial track is the raw points income track. I found cards that give significant improvements on this track to be somewhat rare, and hard to construct when you did get them. Most of these cards require a lot of stone, which is a resource another type of building produces.<br /><br />My second play of this game took about 5.5 hours plus about an hour of rules with 2 players. In that play, I would up missing the 2 stone production building. I wasn’t worried, thinking I would grab the 3 stone building when it finally hit the conveyor belt of cards but due to the random element inherent in a card driven game, the 3 stone card didn’t come out until late into the pile, and despite having a ton of 1 stone production buildings, I fell impossibly behind my opponent in points income. To compensate, I pushed into Military, thinking that If I could hit my opponent with the negative effects of the events it would provide me a catch-up opportunity, but the game has a very odd mechanism for military. You get a separate, much smaller budget of action markers for recruiting military units, and spending to play military event cards. Additionally at the end of your turn, you draw new cards from the event deck equal to the number of unused military actions you have. This meant that I was spending my military actions to build up forces, and my opponent meanwhile was able to fill his hand with either high scoring non-military events he could seed into the events deck, or high value defense cards he could use to counter my aggression and war cards. The result was a lot of failed actions and frustration on my part, as I led on the military track through the entire game, but in 6 hours only got the benefits of hitting my opponent once. My opponent said that by not spending his military actions he also was drawing enough cards that he saw a lot of cards that would have been powerful for me go by and he was able to just discard them. Luck of the draw here also didn’t help me, as I often times would only draw peaceful events and I didn’t much to help my strategy.<br /><br />I enjoyed a lot of the process of this game. I liked the way the cubes moved around the board meaning different things in different places. I liked the card drafting mechanism. I enjoyed the theme. The game also reminded me of a lot of games I’ve really loved in the past, however the downtime between turns is extremely long, and for the overall length of the game I’m not thrilled with the luck driven elements. ",
                "Played this recently one time. It is solid, not THAT hard to understand, although there are some confusing small rules, and ofcourse i sucked big time, because i was more busy remembering stuff and trying some things out instead of being really competitive. This game does MANY things good! I love the many tactics, mechanics which seem to work together effortly, and also really cool is the giant timeline in which you really have the feeling to go \" through the ages\" . Just like in Twilight Struggle, you are not playing a \" race\"  or a \" player\" but you are some overlord watching down as the years go by, tactically influencing events and leaders by playing cards, something i really like. <br /><br />The only pure negative for me is the timeframe. 3 hours is really long BUT... its 3 hours well spend(to be fair, Twilight Struggle mostly lasts just as long as does chess) and what it really does well is that feeling of progression to keep stuff interesting. Nothing feels more dragging as doing the same stuff in turn 1 as you do in turn 3939 (i am looking at you, Village..) . <br /><br />Overal, verdict: want to play again and some more after that! Well done",

On top of that, I've played literally hundreds of times against the AI in the extremely well-implemented phone app (including the expansion). I've beaten all the Challenges, including the expansion, but one. The last one still eludes me after hundreds of attempts."

                "Excellent 2 and 3 player game, where the inside out turn order makes the downtime a bit high for 4.<br /><br />The game is masterclass on luck management—card lane order of guest arrivals is random, dice rolling is random, bonus scoring is random-at-start, but you get the agency you need to make each of just 14 turns  optimal under the circumstances, and you can reason about what to do over multiple turns, including being ready to handle the periodic scoring rounds. It has a feel of a late 90s early 00s game in its production and art style, and this might be one reason it flies slightly under the radar, as well as being effectively a 2-3 player game. It gets one single and more than slight ding for an almost unreadable, albeit thematic, font choice for the worker cards' titles.  It's a great pity it has not seen an expansion cycle, other than a one and done kickstarter, since its internal structure had plenty of ways to support add-ons. <br /><br />All told, a sharp, absorbing, tight game: one of the best dice drafters ever made, and a strong candidate for best 'post-gateway-euro' of the 2010s.<br /><br />2015",

The dice make it really hard to plan rounds ahead, so you have to rely on the staff cards to create any kind of strategy. Problem is, I don't think the staff cards are very well balanced and obtaining them is just luck of the draw. Interesting game, but it's not what I am looking for in a euro.",

The hotel theme is captured well and I bought the upgraded dishes and drinks components from Etsy to add to the thematic immersion. Refreshingly optimal at 2 players as downtime would be too much with 3-4. <br /><br />My typical grievances with this genre apply here, namely the distinct lack of direct player interaction and dense iconography. The game also lacks elegance with stodgy tracks and layers that I think makes the game take a little more than it gives. <br />",

                "Good midweight modern euro. There's a fixed number of turns so it always feels like there's not a lot of time to do everything. Curious to see if it will still be interesting to play after the learning curve has been climbed.

I always felt like I had a strategy yet this was simple enough in concept that it was definitely not a heavy game. I had low expectations for some reason despite the positive hype this game gets but I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoy the idea about the harbor giving you a free re-deploy action as well as the ability to create buildings that you own and get bonuses for when others go there. Definitely play with expansions though, if you can. This game is neat in that it has so many choices that you really want to do but you cannot do them all. Definitely exceeded my expectations.",
