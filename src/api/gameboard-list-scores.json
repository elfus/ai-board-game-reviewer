                "1 play in. It is a good mix of mechanisms and highly indirectly interactive. Can go in with a rough strategy in mind but I find it difficult to plan more than a few moves in advance because the board state changes quite fast. Does provide options to pivot, however.",

                "Yea, it's good. Tough to grok, but really not that hard to play so make the effort and give this a whirl -- you almost assuredly will be glad you did."
