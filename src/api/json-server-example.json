        "Kurz: \"Brass: Birmingham\" ist ein interaktives Netzwerk-/Aufbauspiel mit interessanter Markt-Mechanik. In etwa der Hälfte des Spiels wird der Großteil der gebauten Dinge wieder abgeräumt. Das sorgt für Spannung. Mir macht es Spaß. Ich sehe es aber NICHT, als eines der allerbesten Spiele an.<br /><br />Langform:<br />Wir haben hier ein solides Spiel, bei dem ich verstehen kann, warum es den Leuten gefällt. Aber das beste Brettspiel? Ich persönlich finde Spiele wie z.B. \"Food Chain Magnate\" oder \"Mombasa\" wesentlich besser. (m.M.n. ist auch \"Nukleum\" besser)<br />Es gibt 2 Zeitalter die einerseits dafür sorgen, das man überlegen muss, was man wann baut. Andererseits ist es etwas deprimierend, wenn ein großer Teil der gebauten Strukturen wieder weg geräumt wird.<br />Die beiden Zeitalter, das jeder \"BauOrt\" nur einmal existiert und das man die Rohstoffe der Anderen nutzen darf, machen das Spiel sehr interaktiv,  (\"Euro-Games sind ja üblicherweise eher Multiplayer-Solitär). Dieser hohe Grad an Interaktion kann aber auch anstrengend sein.<br />Außerdem verleitet dieser Mix zu Analysis-Paralysis.<br />Da jeder Gebäudeplatz nur 1x besteht, entsteht ein Wettstreit um Diese und den Verbindungen dazwischen.<br /><br />Nebeninfos:<br />-es gibt eine gewisse Lernkurve<br />-es gibt mehrere Wege zum Ziel, scheinbar aber auch welche die etwas besser sind<br />-Die Kanal- und BahnÄra scheinen auch geschichtlich gut zu passen.<br />-interessanter Markt-Mechanismus<br />-\"Brass: Birmingham\" unterscheidet sich mit \"Brass: Lancashire\" (vor langer Zeit als \"Kohle\" erschienen) u.A. durch das Bier und die speziellen Märkte. Man könnte es als erweiterte Edition zu Lanceshire/\"Kohle\" sehen.<br />-&gt; \"Kohle\" sah übrigens überhaupt nicht ansprechend aus. Die beiden \"Brass\"-Editionen dagegen sehr.<br /><br />Unbedingt nochmal, aber nicht für meine eigene Sammlung.<br /><br />(Ursprungs-Kommentar aus 02/2024:<br />Eine abgebrochene Partie, daher keine Bewertung.(nach erstem Zeitalter)<br />Es blieb mir im Gedächtnis, das es sehr interaktiv (fast schon aggressiv) ist. Und sehr verzahnt.)",

        "My first Legacy type game.<br />I liked this way of telling a story that evolves as the games progress. The rules are quite simple at the beginning of the game, but become numerous at the end of the game; and it is very easy to forget some of them unintentionally.<br />To win the last month, you only need luck.<br />Very good times spent! I recommend it for those who haven't played it yet (Be careful, it will certainly bring back memories of Covid XD)",
        "I really enjoy cooperative legacy games, it's fun to play through what feels like a story with the same group over series of separate games/sessions. I don't especially love Pandemic by itself, but the legacy aspect and the complexities added by it each game are entertaining enough that playing through Pandemic Legacy has been one of my favorite gaming experiences.",

        "Was good but honestly wish it was a bit shorter. <br /><br />If you play with good friends you'll have a great time! But mostly because your friends are likely fun to be around. <br /><br />We had the most fun telling our own stories joking about character names we made up ect. Most of that wasn't brought by the game which is a bummer... but i gotta giveit credit for putting us in a positionto have fun with eachother. <br /><br />After 14 games i dont feel like i ever need to play pandemic again... it was fun but moat games you could tell if you were going to win about half way through. <br /><br />Personally thought it was just a little to easy.",

        "Highly overrated. The base game is better because the rules are more simple. This game offers novelty and new gadgets after each round. But the rules are getting more complicated each step so that it's hard to keep track. You also need a group of players who will play the entire season; the same game over and over again. On top of that they messed up the theme (the obligatory DEI characters etc). <br /><br />Positive side is the developing storyline which makes it slightly more interesting",
        "Like so many who have come to board games recently, PL Season 1 is where I fell in love with board games.",
        "I've enjoyed this game. We're about halfway through the campaign right now and it has been a roller coaster ride. One problem I have with the pandemic series, however, is that it is very easy for one player to sort of steamroll the decision making process in the game, which kind of makes everyone else sort of feel like they're along for the ride. With all the cool whistles and bells in this game, it still doesn't manage to address that problem. Regardless, it's still fun.",
