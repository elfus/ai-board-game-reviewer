In etwa der Hälfte des Spiels wird der Großteil der gebauten Dinge wieder abgeräumt. Das sorgt für Spannung. Mir macht es Spaß. Ich sehe es aber NICHT, als eines der allerbesten Spiele an.<br /><br />Langform:<br />Wir haben hier ein solides Spiel, bei dem ich verstehen kann, warum es den Leuten gefällt. Aber das beste Brettspiel? Ich persönlich finde Spiele wie z.B. \"Food Chain Magnate\" oder \"Mombasa\" wesentlich besser. (m.M.n. ist auch \"Nukleum\" besser)<br />Es gibt 2 Zeitalter die einerseits dafür sorgen, das man überlegen muss, was man wann baut. Andererseits ist es etwas deprimierend, wenn ein großer Teil der gebauten Strukturen wieder weg geräumt wird.<br />Die beiden Zeitalter, das jeder \"BauOrt\" nur einmal existiert und das man die Rohstoffe der Anderen nutzen darf, machen das Spiel sehr interaktiv,  (\"Euro-Games sind ja üblicherweise eher Multiplayer-Solitär). Dieser hohe Grad an Interaktion kann aber auch anstrengend sein.<br />Außerdem verleitet dieser Mix zu Analysis-Paralysis.<br />Da jeder Gebäudeplatz nur 1x besteht, entsteht ein Wettstreit um Diese und den Verbindungen dazwischen.<br /><br />Nebeninfos:<br />-es gibt eine gewisse Lernkurve<br />-es gibt mehrere Wege zum Ziel, scheinbar aber auch welche die etwas besser sind<br />-Die Kanal- und BahnÄra scheinen auch geschichtlich gut zu passen.<br />-interessanter Markt-Mechanismus<br />-\"Brass: Birmingham\" unterscheidet sich mit \"Brass: Lancashire\" (vor langer Zeit als \"Kohle\" erschienen) u.A. durch das Bier und die speziellen Märkte. Man könnte es als erweiterte Edition zu Lanceshire/\"Kohle\" sehen.<br />-&gt; \"Kohle\" sah übrigens überhaupt nicht ansprechend aus. Die beiden \"Brass\"-Editionen dagegen sehr.<br /><br />Unbedingt nochmal, aber nicht für meine eigene Sammlung.<br /><br />(Ursprungs-Kommentar aus 02/2024:<br />Eine abgebrochene Partie, daher keine Bewertung.(nach erstem Zeitalter)<br />Es blieb mir im Gedächtnis, das es sehr interaktiv (fast schon aggressiv) ist.

The core mechanics of card management, movement, and battle do offer meaningful decisions.<br /><br />Update after 7 plays: I had hopes that the scenario themes, challenges, and variety of decisions would continue to increase with time. They haven't. I'm still having fun with great friends, but each scenario appears to be just a variant of \"kill all of the monsters in this dungeon\" every time. The minor flavor text at the beginning of each one are simply to figure out which fork of the path you choose, but then you just end up in a room killing all the monsters again. Still having fun, but I think I will tire of this before we get anywhere near playing them all.<br /><br />Most recent play Dec ‘19.",

JoTL had a more appropriate scale to the writing, I feel. Unlocking characters keeps this semi-engaging, but things don't develop as much as I would want or expect. I was expecting more from the writing, or perhaps less, so as to leave room for more imagination. The mechanics are a finely tuned machine, of course. To be fair, I am keen to play at least one session of Frosthaven to see what parts of the beast Isaac has sanded down, and which he's polished up.",

When I see this game ranked this high on BGG, I genuinely assume that the people rating it just don’t play RPG videogames. Even the Steam digital version of Gloomhaven blows playing in paper out of the water.

                "Played 3p with expansion.<br /><br />I won with a zoo funded by a ponzi scheme.  For the longest time i kept getting sponsors, no animals.<br /><br />This one is a really hard game to rate.  On one hand the game really is just draw until you find a win-con, on the hand theres a sort jazz-improv approaching to forming an engine to this game.  That ponzi scheme zoo i won with?:  it started as a European Fish zoo, had the sponsors for it an everything.  Then i didnt draw a single European animals the rest of the game, nor was there any in the display (think shop kinda).  I had to switch to trying win off of small animals, then small herbivores.  Again, on one hand i can attribute my win to 2-3 cards i just happened to draw, but also i drew A LOT and A LOT of it was just not usable for me.  That also said, a lot of the cards I passed up on were gaming winning in their own right.  It reminds of Slay the Spire in that i have no idea what I am going for at first, then i find something good, then I just spec into that hard and hope it works out, and frankly in this context I get why this game is so highly rated, BUT unlike Slay the Spire I cant play this game in under 1 hour XD AND much like Slay the Spire if you somehow dont lean into a strategy fast enough it can get bad, BUT you can in a very controlled manner buff the hell out of your draws (in burst, basically look up the action selection system, i like it a lot, and more cards played into it that i wouldve though).  So basically if you chill out and everyone is lax, the game is pretty fun, but if you want serious eurogaming or loooove 4x and refuse to settle for less this isnt for you.  <br /><br />I dont want to get into the gameplay too much because this game is on the line of being heavyweight, and my thoughts on the nature of this games strategy is long enough, so basically: action system your action cards are basically assigned a random slot/level/power (higher power=do more/better stuff with the card), Use a card and the lower slots level up and the card you use goes back to slot/level/power 1.  Again, i like this, theres a lot of decision space in this already, and again theres cards that mess with this a bit.   Also you can perma upgrade some of these cards.  The zoo itself has a Feast of Odin/Isle of Cats tile laying thing going on, as do scoring cards in addition to set collection.  End of game add conservation points from cards that have endgame scoring (i had like 3ish, and again i had way more sponsor cards than everyone else who had like 1 maybe 2 endgame scoring cards).  Based on your conservation points you get a target number (smaller is better for target number, and its written on the board).  Appeal (you get a lot of these, every animal you play gives appeal as do other cards) minus Target number = vp.  This took us like 45 seconds to calculate, one of my friends and I were stunned.  We had out calculators out, we were ready to spend 10 minutes calculating 8x different factors.  Nope, find target number, subtract that from appeal bingo bango done.  On one hand this is REALLY anticlimatic, but again, i chillaxed, because that calculation is craaaazy slick, i am honestly adding points for this.  Also because this game is too random, this game doesnt have a tight amount of actions/turns, and i like that in heavier games a lot.<br /><br />Quick opinion on expansion: its nice, nothing feels op, zero problem learning this first play.  I didnt realize for balance reasons it removes cards from the base game.  I have since shuffled all the cards into a pile (not a deck, pile).  Oops<br /><br />I have one solid issue with this game:  the icons on cards are EGREGIOUS.  50%-75% are to signify text THATS ALREADY ON THE CARD, text mind you, is concise and explains it perfecftly, the icons are ALL OVER THE CARD its bad and distracting XD.  With this many icons i genuinely think you need 4x quick references, not 1x<br /><br />So back to my predicament, this game is way too chill for its weight (i say its like 3 - 3.25 in weight imo).  Again, thats a good thing and a bad thing which is why this game is SO hard to rate for  me.  Its somewhere between an 8 and a 9  for me for sure, because, again, great game, but too random bullshit go.  I ll give a few extra points because for whatever reason this game is ALWAYS on sale.  I am sure this has popped up on prime days, nerdz days, and at time of writing i am sure it will go on a publisher wide sale two more times this year time of writing.  Its not even that expensive (i wish it was like $10 less on MSRP tbh).  8.75 is the score i can give that gives me the least amount of conflict.  <br /><br />10 - Perfect<br /> 9 - Perfect, but I wish it was a little more exciting, possibly missing an x-factor<br /> 8 - Pretty darn good, get it if you can afford it, maybe some gripes<br /> 7 - Pretty good, would recommend getting if it is on sale<br /> 6 - It's fine, maybe get if there's a heavy sale<br /> 5 - Little boring, the game is functional though, wouldnt recommend buying<br /> 4 - Is technically a game<br /> 3 - The so-bad-its-good movie of board games<br /> 2 - Somehow even worse<br /> 1 - Purely hypothetical, unimaginably bad"

I'm lucky to have a group that can dedicate a day to this monstrosity with some regularity. It's worth trying at least two times. It can be punishing and a let down if you're competitive and some players are making clear blunder after blunder because it requires counter moves to balance the game, but that's to be expected.",

The characters are all very unique and fun to play, bringing a drastically different flavor to the party. It does suffer from having long set-up and play times, and some of the missions are particularly tough, seeming almost like they weren't playtested enough. However, the satisfying, clever gameplay and customization you can put into your character keeps me coming back time and time again. This is a great legacy game for semi-experienced gamers to pick up and enjoy, but difficult to recommend to new gamers or anyone with analysis paralysis. The value you get for the price is well-worth it alone, and as long as you can commit to learning it and taking the time to set it up, Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is high on the list of games to dedicate a weekend to.",

                "I adore everything about Spirit Island. The anti-colonialism theme, the depth of strategy, the pacing...everything. It's the perfect co-op game for me. It's far too complicated for alpha player/quarterbacking. Each Spirit plays out differently and figuring out how to upgrade them each game is a puzzle that is difficult to master. <br /><br />This is one of the few games I remember HATING, because it was so hard. There was something about the design that drew me in and forced me to get better. I remember looking up Youtube videos, and reading beginners guides. I kept playing solo games until something finally clicked in my brain. Ever since that \"eureka\" moment I've been obsessed with the game. I don't think I'd ever play it with more than 3 players. Also, some of the graphic design is kind of ugly/outdated. Maybe in the next couple of years this will see a second edition that takes years of feedback to clean up the rules, make it more approachable, and prettier. ",

                "Sprit Island is a pretty heavy-euro asymmetrical cooperative game where you're controlling spirits trying to protect an island from colonial invaders. The game is pretty infamous for being heavy but if you're experienced with a decent amount of medium-weight games then it's honestly not that bad to transition into it. I would never recommend someone that's not experienced with boardgames to play this one because there is just too much going on here.<br /><br /><br />This game is very prone to analysis paralysis and it's a very thinky game: which growth do I take? Do I spread presence or should I reclaim my cards? If I spread presence, should I beef up my energy or cards track? Where should I spread my presence? Which cards should I use? Which space should I focus on saving? And then once you make all those decisions, you think you have a good plan and then realize you can't actually achieve it because you don't have sacred sites where you need them or your abilities would be triggered slow. While the objectives are pretty straightforward there's just a lot of them in there. With all of that said, this can be a good or bad thing depending on the person that's playing this game. It's funny that my wife and I played this game very close to release and enjoyed it, played it again years later and were both incredibly confused on how to play this game, then we played it again years later and we enjoyed it again. Your decisions and the order in which you execute them matter so much in this game. There isn't always obvious choices to make. To me I think these are signs of an incredibly well designed game. While this game requires a lot of effort to get familiar with, I think it's worth trying if you enjoy euro-style games and you want something a little heavier and punishing.<br /><br />The game is aesthetically pleasing. The artwork is nice and the boards and cards are very high quality. With that said though some tracking of the game feels a little too loosely tracked, like orienting Dahan or towns / cities to display health or tracking which powers are in play and what kind of modifiers they may have. There's a lot going on in this game and it's easy to lose sight of some things! I do feel like the way the game is physically designed could have mitigated some of these issues (for example printing health on pieces to display health on certain sides / adding ability modifier reminder tokens / adding elemental track lines). This is definitely one of those games that the more you get familiar with it, the more I think you'll enjoy it. You'll most likely learn something new about it every time you play it.<br /><br />All the spirits play very differently so mixing and matching spirits seems like a way to get a lot out of the game's replayability. Overall my wife and I enjoyed this game quite a bit and we're excited to keep on playing it.",

Did love the strategy of cycling through the cattle trail and trying to strategically amplify capabilities with each circuit; was kind of not done exploring that when game end triggered. Also like the token-placement mechanic when you sold cattle at the end of the trail that let you reward yourself with abilities depending on which token you move, even if I did take a few that ended up being superfluous - I know what I'd focus on next time. Did try to diversify my capabilities/scoring in a way that blocked me from completing a few major-point accomplishments, which was a bit of a bummer as I wanted the freedom to engage with more of the board.",

                "Es ist ein Würdiger, ebenso grandioser Nachfolger von Gloomhaven. Wenige Nuancen sorgen in meinen Augen dafür, das mir Gloomhaven minimal besser gefallen hat.<br />U.A.<br />-Frosthaven ist weniger Einsteigerfreundlich, weil es etwas mehr Umfang bietet. z.B. der langsame aber stätige Aufbau des Außenpostens.<br />-Die Szenarien dauern länger. (Haben noch kein Szenario unter 2h gespielt. Bei Gloomhaven war das der Durchschnitt.)<br />-Trotz gesetzten Fokus auf die Geschichtenerzählung, springt man zwischen den unterschiedlichen Storyläufen hin und her. (Stichwort \"Kalendereinträge\")<br />-Zusätzlich sind die Szenarien von Beginn an härter, dafür etwas Abwechslungsreicher.<br />-Der Vorteil, nicht gespoilert zu werden, sorgt aber für Unterbrechnungen im Spiel, durch Aufbau neuer Räume und/oder neue Regeln<br /><br />Aber ich wiederhole gern nochmal: Frosthaven ein großartiges Spiel und die aufgezählten Punkte nur Kleinigkeiten.<br /><br />Der einzige Punkt, der auch schon in Gloomhaven relevant war: Es brauch eine feste Spieler-Gruppe und Regelmäßigkeit. Da ich beides habe, ist es super.",
                "Great sequel. I will say that some of the additions during the outpost phase add lots of overhead in between scenarios without actually improving the experience. Not a reason not to play but Gloomhaven does feel like a more pure or straightforward version of the game.",
                "De tussen fase(outpost fase) is wel zeer uitgebreid wat deels goed is, gezien het spel uitbreidt maar misschien iets teveel.<br />Gloomhaven overdonderd mij en dit spel zou ik niet aanraden als je eerst 'haven' game.   Jaws of the lion is daarentegen zeer aantrekkelijk door zijn snelle opstart.  Bij frosthaven heb je nu nog meer setup / teardown Dan Bij gloomhaven.   <br />Op zich is het verhaal wel zeer goed en uitgebreider.   Ik vermoed dat dit spel nog gaat stijgen in rating na meerdere malen spelen. De setting is nog beter dan gloomhaven ook. <br />Het begin lijkt gewoon net dat tikkeltje teveel qua overzicht. <br />De characters zijn wel heel divers.  Daarbovenop nog thematischer en speciaal dan gloomhaven.   <br />",
                "Co-owned with Jee, Paul Ar & Jacob.<br /><br />It's mental, enormous and (perhaps unsurprisingly at this point) pretty damn solid.<br /><br />Update: 1+ year in, and about 35 or so missions. Damn the outpost phase is too long and not interesting enough. Unsurprisingly, I think the game would be better if it was half the size and 20% tighter. There's a ton of unneccessary fluff in here.<br /><br />Rating down from 7.9 to 7.2",
                "The rules videos advertised on the publisher's own site are nearly 2 hours long.  That's just explaining the rules.  The goal here is to make a huge world that you can dig into.  That's cool, but the various little exceptions (crafting items can't be taken from the frosthaven supply, but herbs can... okay?) mean you have to go around remembering ALL SORTS OF LITTLE THINGS just to play the game.  If you don't do it correctly, because it's a legacy/campaign game, your error can compound.  <br /><br />Way too heavy for what the game is.  Way too much effort to immerse through fiddly bits rather than imagination and smoothness.  Way too expensive and bulky.<br /><br />But still a good game.  I'd play it again.",

                "Sleeved",
                "It rivals Gloomhaven, with a fun city build mechanic. Learning the combos within your party is great. I play solo, and have enjoyed. Of course, I should mention I have a game table that I can cover, hence it can stay out all the time when not playing.<br />",
                "Not very far into this yet. It's just as good as Gloomhaven and really improves on it in some ways. I think the town building is such a great change to the overall game. We enjoy going to town and doing all that stuff just as much as doing the scenarios now.",
                "Original class system and combat. It's first and foremost a combat puzzle, with a stupid amount of upkeep in between scenarios, annoyingly slow character progression, and a bland mediocre story. I've played 30+ times and I've got no idea what the hell is going on in the overarching story. It's hard to feel invested when the characters you play have no stake in it.<br /><br />And don't get into it if you are expecting a dungeon crawler / adventure game. It's way more euro than ameritrash.<br /><br />I'd rate this 8/10 if you could get it in a much smaller box with just the class/combat system and non of the story/upkeep/sims bloat that's more excel than game.<br /><br />"

                "A very streamlined take on the Pax series, which IMO makes it easily my favorite. Beautiful art and components, relatively modest rules for the meaty decision space, and lots of player interaction so I always have to pay close attention to what everyone else is doing. <br /><br />In this game, the board state is constantly shifting on all fronts: the shop, the map, the deals between players and faction allegiances. It really makes you feel like a corrupt psychopath politician. Throughout the entire game I am always engaged and desperately trying to figure out how to opportunistically squeeze out a victory condition. <br /><br />This game however isn't for everyone. It is a VERY mean game with a lot of player disruption. You have to play both fast and loose to succeed, so building up an engine isn't usually viable even though you have a card tableu, because the other players will take out your stuff. Further, if you don't know what you are doing, you will look like you are flailing around and can even accidentally (potentially frustratingly) kingmake from an experienced player's perspective. This game definitely needs a dedicated group of players who have the awareness to really \"get it\" to succeed. <br /><br />If you don't have that though, at least there is a really good and difficult solo mode that also works well when playing at 2 player to make the game feel more like 3-4 player, so this game is more versatile in player count compared to Wehrle’s other designs like Root. <br /><br />This game is also surprisingly short, which has pros and cons. Since the last dominance check is worth double points, sometimes it feels as though the work/points you built up for the first 3/4 of the game feel kinda meaningless. I do understand that this is meant to make sure everyone is in the game, but it also means that getting points in the first two dominances can make everyone bully you but to no benefit for the final stretch of the game. But since the game is short, so you can easily just shuffle up and deal again. <br /><br />Overall, definitely recommend if you are into this type of tense, mean game that requires lots of on the fly thinking and awareness. But certainly stay FAR away if you are not. If you are on the fence, maybe try a more diet version of this, like Inis or even the new Arcs, which are both much less extreme than this. ",

                "2024-08-02 (2 plays at 4): Strong first impression. A little hard to parse after the teach, but it gets there in play. I played with a few rules wrong, but hopefully not in such a way as to radically alter the character of the game. It's beautiful. I struggled a bit to remember what was on everyone else's tableaus, and the passive powers on a card across the table are completely invisible to me. Apart from that, it has a strong sense of narrative, and it's not too heavy. The weight score on BGG is way overblown. I think we had a more static and friendly game than is likely. I would play again in the hope of building a stronger relationship with the game.",
                "Multiplayer: I think this is a good game but am not sure how much I enjoy politicking. As a politicking game, I like how there is a simple board state that brings the negotiation to the forefront. <br /><br />Does not affect my rating, but I don't think there is any reason to add this to my collection. Given that it is mean I would be hard pressed to play this in person. And I perfer the mechanical play of other mean games more.<br /><br />Solo Pros:<br />- Simple setup<br />- Seemingly complicated board states<br />- Good chance to make a comeback<br /><br />Solo Cons:<br />- Wakham seems to play poorly and be easy to beat by grabbing up political cards",
                "2020-12<br />Pax Pamir's biggest strength is how much it achieves with such lean rules. It's attractively easy to teach, and the various matrices interlock and interact beautifully.<br /><br />2023-01<br />The statement above is so widely known, it's barely worth mentioning. So let me try to say what I like about the game, at least when it comes to 4-5 players: It's how the game challenges you to predict upcoming turns. You need good instincts to see ahead and make good decisions now to come up ahead later. The way it does that is what lifts it above other multiplayer games.",

                "This game is overly complicated in that special Vital way, but the parts fit together  a little more cohesively than previous games. That's not to say that this game couldn't use a little streamlining, but I guess if you are into Vital's style of game this is probably your bag. It took me 3/4ths of the way through my first game before I started really understanding the flow and consequences of the different action options.<br /><br />The game flow is pretty nice. There are a dizzying number of options to do on your turn, but ultimately it comes down to play a card, then do 2 things based on the card you played and where you played it to. The graphic design helps and hurts in different ways. When you need to do something, there's usually an indicator reminding you to do it, however, the board layout and artwork is disorientingly busy. The icons are very small, and the numbers to look up what the icons mean are even smaller. This is also a game where you can expect to still be looking up what icons do even deep into the game, as some icons are used to mean two different things depending on the context of their appearance, and other icons are used only once and then never again.<br /><br />The player interaction in this game is more about predicting your opponents and trying to piggy back their moves more than it is about actually being able to do much to get in their way and hurt their scores. There are some surprising but minor luck elements of the game such as the order in which endgame scoring cards come out onto the display, and the tokens you start with.<br /><br />Generally I like the experience of this game. Playing it does wear me out however, whereas a really solid medium euro will energize me. ",

                "Seit langer Zeit suche ich ein kooperatives Spiel, bei dem ich mich mit Würfeln durch ein thematisches Setting und Gegnerhorden durchmetzle. Keines konnte uns überzeugen, auch wenn ein paar gute uns kurzfristig befriedigt haben. Dieses Spiel macht vieles anders: die Gegnerhorden sind groß, aber nicht unüberwindbar. Die Angriffe der Gegner sind gemein, boosten aber auch meine Fähigkeiten. Die gesamte Schwierigkeit ist fordernd, aber machbar. Hinzu kommt die wahnsinnige Vielfalt durch sechs unterschiedliche Episoden, die von Spielrunde zu Spielrunde ein neues Setting, neue Regeln und ein neues Spielgefühl erschaffen. Insgesamt ist Cthulhu: Death May Die einfach wahnsinnig clever. Alle Mechaniken, von den Fähigkeiten über die Entdeckungen bis hin zu den Proben, sind einfach stimmig und machen mir persönlich Spaß. WENN das Spiel nicht dieses absolut langweilige, ausgelutschte Setting mit den teilweise formlosen, hässlichen Monstern hätte, würde ich die Bestbewertung geben. Jedes andere Setting hätte mir besser gefallen! Trotzdem ein wirklich starkes Spiel, an dem ich mich jetzt erstmal sattspielen möchte.",

                "This game is just.... Amazing. The weight on here is way too high, it plays much simpler than you'd expect and is such political balance goodness. Will always say yes to playing this and the balance across the classes is so brilliant!",
                "Impressive game, but at the same time it didn't really excite me, so I'm indifferent about playing it again.",
                "A very interesting game. I love the interaction between the asymmetrical classes. Having said that there are some very serious and frustrating balance issues in this game. Unforgivable for such a long game.",
                "People seem to love or hate Hegemony, so I figured I'd share a middle-of-the-road review after one play.  <br /><br />First off, this game is LONG.  Our first game, without a teach (competent players prepped) was around 5 hours. The rules are reasonable, but there is a fair amount of \"we need to look this up\" fiddliness.  I strongly suggest having the rulebook open in searchable pdf form for your first game.  The game could potentially shorten upon subsequent plays, but if those plays are spaced out far enough, you'll definitely be relearning nuances again.  Plus, each faction is different, which is super cool, but also adds to play time as you try new roles.  At 5 hours, the game is too long for what it is.  If I could get through the entire game in 2.5-3 hours, it would be worthwhile.<br /><br />I am not a huge theme person. However, I do like it when a theme matches a game well.  Hegemony's theme and mechanics integrate as well as any game I've seen.  The theme itself is interesting but not incredibly novel. However, trying to simulate a politico-economic system and pulling it off this well is laudable.<br /><br />Hegemony uses asymmetrical factions which lie along a continuum of interests creating the potential for interesting player interactions.  My group played with four players until the government player had to leave, then we finished the last two rounds with three players. I would strongly suggest four players to make this game really shine.  I can't imagine how it would be any good at two.  Hegemony is basically a COIN game without dudes on a map and with TI4 flavored policy voting.  You play cards to either take  basic actions or to take the card actions.  As at least one other person mentioned on here, the card actions are just okay and seem like more powerful versions of the basic actions.  I liked having to decide which actions to play when and which cards to discard for basic actions. That was one of the most interesting parts of the game.<br /><br />There's one aspect to Hegemony that I didn't like, but is totally subjective.  I am really bad at convincing other people to take moves that are beneficial to them. There are other players who are really good at convincing other players to do whatever they want them to do. Over the years I have become less and less of a fan of cooperative and semi-cooperative games. I like to just play my game and deal with situations as they arise. I'm also not good at negotiation. In Sidereal Confluence, I could be like \"Take these 12 green cubes for one yellow\" and the other player would ignore me and trade two yellow for one green.  That's me. If you're like that too, this game may not be for you.  If you are a silver-tongued charismatic half elf bard, then enjoy!  Watching someone make a move that stalls your game is challenging.  Having that happen in a 5-hour game can be a bit demoralizing. I'm sure that as people really grok the game, the negotiation aspect will become fairer and more interesting.  However, combined with an arduous ruleset, this can lead to player confusion, creating untenable decisions with cascading consequences.<br /><br />So, I think Hegemony is one of those games that requires the right group of people. You need people who will prep the game ahead of time and know what they're doing going in. Whatever you do, please do not teach and try to play this game on the same night.  You also need people that get along with one another, as the push and pull could get tense. I can imagine having hypercompetitive people playing with more laid-back gamers, especially those new to the game, could lead to unfun. Luckily, my first game didn't feel like that.  <br /><br />In the end, I would suggest Hegemony to groups who are going to play the game frequently and often. If this game is going to sit on your shelf and come out once every 2 or 3 years, I just don't think it's worth the effort.",
                "Realistic simulation of how everything in state politics and economy is intertwined. Highly engaging and fun. Not for the faint hearted, lasts long … Best at four players, but can be played even with two with the expansion.",
                "The different policies result in fun disputes and cause thematic ripple effects on the board. However, for the majority of the game, I don’t feel like much of a political mastermind because of the cards: many of them feel less like thematic events and more like random boosts to your basic actions, which can a) make hands play themselves and b) make it easy to get out of a pickle. Since the game can easily take 5 hours, I end up wishing there was a more brutal or negotiation-heavy version of Hegemony that would justify the time spent.",
                "a bit daunting at first to learn this game. but once we started playing , it was quite simple because how thematic it is .  one play in , I would love to try other roles. rating might increase in the future. <br />",
                "Brilliant simulation of the political struggle between the working class, middle class and capitalist class in a fictional nation state. As a political scientist myself I appreciate the neutrality in the presentstion of the subject matter. Most importantly, the game is very much fun to play due to interesting interactions and dilemmas.",
                "+ Great simulative model of a modern political/economical system<br />+ The interactions between the 4 classes and their interests are inextricably intervowen<br />+ Political agenda and voting add an element of tension and unpredictability to each round<br /><br />= Each class seem to have a main way to succeed, and maybe it could lead to a feeling of repetitiveness on the long run?<br /><br />- Feels a bit too long, during the first plays<br />- Rules are well written, but they're also a lot to teach",
                "Another asymmetric game where everybody's too tired to look at the other boards, too exhausted to talk. So nothing interesting happens."

                "10x10 2017. Quite a good coop programming game.  Coop games can fall a little flat for me when they're to dry and puzzley.  This game avoids that with the frenetic programming.  You plan together but then you end up just having to do your best with the cards that come out.  The timer helps with this too.  Otherwise it would be possible for this game to be an AP nightmare.  As it is it's almost the opposite, trending a little more towards chaos.  The different mission provide a lot of variety.  Currently we're stuck at around the second to last mission.  And of course the production values are completely through the roof- it looks like it should cost twice as much as it does.  Ended up feeling kind of done with it with my group which is why I sold it.",
                "This game is excellent! Fully expect rating on this game to go up even more once we are finished with the campaign. The game is a programming game but you also have lots of options such as which way to turn, how many spaces to move, whether to tow or not, which card to draft, where to place the card, etc. It takes coordination with the teammates to determine who is going to try and do what and which actions people need to accomplish that strategy. The damage system is cool and there is so much more we have not even seen yet. Can't wait to keep going to the next missions!",

                "We worked our way through all the missions of Mechs vs. Minions.  The game starts with a lot of verve, and we fell in love with it.  Eventually the game started to feel repetitive.  But I still like Mechs vs. Minions.  As cooperative games go, this is one of the better ones.",
                "This is an incredibly fun fully co-op game. Each player gets an action board with 6 empty slots for cards. Each round you get a card and place it into one of the slots. The card has a type of movement on it, and an effect. If you place a card on top of a card of the same type, the effect of the top card is amplified. Then you resolve your slots from 1-6 and your figure on the board walks around mashing monsters in the way you programed it to do. Then the monsters get to move and attack. Taking damage means you flip cards that will mess up your programing in some way. Sometimes they cover an action slot, sometimes they swap action slots, sometimes they cause an ongoing effect to happen. You can repair damage by discarding a card during the draft rather than program it. The combat is completely diceless, which is fantastic. For a game with this much pageantry, there is surprisingly little randomness. The level ends when you complete or fail your objective, which varies scenario to scenario. <br /><br />Another fantastic element is that the game doesn't have a steep learning curve, as of the cards you draft, there are only 8 different cards, 2 of each color. It really allows you to focus in on the fun puzzle of figuring out how and where you will move and attack on your turn.",
                "Very nice chaotic cooperative campaign game. Not sure about its replayability.",
                "9",
                "All in all, I like Mechs vs Minions. It's clever in what it does while having quite straightforward rules at the same time. And despite having a substantial amount of built-in randomness, it is controllable to a degree and it still offers a good programming puzzle that is strategic and satisfactory when you execute it right. <br /><br />Also, the production value of this game is off the charts. The box is huge, and there is a TON of good-quality plastic (some of which is even pre-painted) and even some metal components, the cards are good quality and the cardboard elements are thick and sturdy. The only minor complaint I may have is that the shiny fragments of map tiles are unfortunately catching scratches quite easily. But overall, the game feels very premium.<br /><br />However, the scenarios are quite uneven. Some are very good, some are just good/ok, and there are also a few that feel unbalanced and not very well-thought.<br /><br />To sum up - a well-designed game that I enjoy most of the time, but which also sometimes has its worse moments.",
                "Solid co-op. The miniatures are top notch. The box is massive. The pre planned movement can get very frustrating if planned incorrectly early. I can see why some would not enjoy it as long term planning is a must and taking a single point of damage throws off your entire plan. That being said, it's fun and enjoyable. There really is no theme and I don't feel like I'm playing League of Legends in the least bit so you won't need to play LoL to enjoy this. On the flip side, if you are looking for a game that captures the League theme, this isn't it.",

I always felt like I had a strategy yet this was simple enough in concept that it was definitely not a heavy game. I had low expectations for some reason despite the positive hype this game gets but I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoy the idea about the harbor giving you a free re-deploy action as well as the ability to create buildings that you own and get bonuses for when others go there. Definitely play with expansions though, if you can. This game is neat in that it has so many choices that you really want to do but you cannot do them all. Definitely exceeded my expectations.",

My wife finds it way too long (our 2-player games take 2-2.5h) and it melts her brain. She has too many possibilities during her turn and she doesn't know what she should do. I love planning 2-3 turns in advance and seeing my plan come through, it's super satisfying. If it were easier to hit the table it would probably be a 10 for me.<br /><br />Played a first 3 player game and it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Played at 6 players with 4 new players and that was a bad idea, even with shortened game length.<br /><br />Currently playing express version with my wife and she loves it. We play with less houses and less cards and can get it done in 1h (excluding setup).",

                "A unique take of dudes-on-a-map that rewards sneaky, tactical, negotiation decision making over crushing your enemies. It's like if you take the area majority, card based action system (kinda), and mechanical elegance of El Grande, combine it with the table-talk negotiation, leader-bashing conflict, and the tactical \"how do I make the best use of my hand\" nature of Cole Wehrle games (especially like Arcs), and then add a beautiful production with classic Celtic art. In other words, an absolute masterpiece of a game. <br /><br />I like this game even better than both of the aforementioned games though for a few reasons. First, this game scales to any available player count with grace. At 2 player, the game feels a lot like high level chess: cutthroat, strategic, low rules overhead, and near-perfect information, but with no real chance of losing because you didn't know an opening. At 3-4 player (and 5 with the Seasons expansion), the game becomes a lot more negotiation heavy with a lot of compromises and plenty of tension. Nothing like Root or El Grande where playing at the non-optimal player counts just feels worse if not awful. <br /><br />The second big reason I like this game more is because it is easy to both get to the table and teach. I've had plenty of success teaching even some non-gamers this game and even if they don't immediately get all of the game's subtleties, they still usually have fun engaging with the game. There is plenty of room to claw towards a victory condition, even if you get bullied early on or you aren't exactly sure what to do. But when you do get this game, the layers of depth and mind games are exquisite. The art being fantastic is also a big plus. <br /><br />The third and final reason is that there aren't any mechanics that I don't have any hiccups on. No weird memory-ish mechanic like the tower in El Grande, and no turn-wasting luck of the dice combat like Root or Arcs. Definitely the smallest point but certainly not an insignificant one. <br /><br />When it comes to cons, this game can theoretically go on forever, but I've never found that to happen as players figured out the game more and become sneakier with their wins (hint: use deeds), and if it's really a problem then the expansion solves it with a new rule that you can easily print out on a piece of paper for reference while playing the base game. <br /><br />Besides that, of course not everyone will enjoy the high player conflict present in this game. You have to be ready to constantly face confrontation. This game also has a literal Uno-style mechanic in it where you wave a giant flag that you are about to win, so a big part of the game is figuring out how to win while being subtle about it so you don't end up playing a bash-the-leader loop all game, so you can’t be asleep at the wheel and have to really invest to get the most out of this game.  Again, not everyone's taste. <br /><br />In summary, this is easily my favorite game of all time because it combines all the things I love: relative mechanical simplicity, high player interaction both social and combative, plenty of depth, great production,and ability to play with a wide variety of groups.
