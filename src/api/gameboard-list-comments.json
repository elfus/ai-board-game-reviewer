In etwa der Hälfte des Spiels wird der Großteil der gebauten Dinge wieder abgeräumt. Das sorgt für Spannung. Mir macht es Spaß. Ich sehe es aber NICHT, als eines der allerbesten Spiele an.<br /><br />Langform:<br />Wir haben hier ein solides Spiel, bei dem ich verstehen kann, warum es den Leuten gefällt. Aber das beste Brettspiel? Ich persönlich finde Spiele wie z.B. \"Food Chain Magnate\" oder \"Mombasa\" wesentlich besser. (m.M.n. ist auch \"Nukleum\" besser)<br />Es gibt 2 Zeitalter die einerseits dafür sorgen, das man überlegen muss, was man wann baut. Andererseits ist es etwas deprimierend, wenn ein großer Teil der gebauten Strukturen wieder weg geräumt wird.<br />Die beiden Zeitalter, das jeder \"BauOrt\" nur einmal existiert und das man die Rohstoffe der Anderen nutzen darf, machen das Spiel sehr interaktiv,  (\"Euro-Games sind ja üblicherweise eher Multiplayer-Solitär). Dieser hohe Grad an Interaktion kann aber auch anstrengend sein.<br />Außerdem verleitet dieser Mix zu Analysis-Paralysis.<br />Da jeder Gebäudeplatz nur 1x besteht, entsteht ein Wettstreit um Diese und den Verbindungen dazwischen.<br /><br />Nebeninfos:<br />-es gibt eine gewisse Lernkurve<br />-es gibt mehrere Wege zum Ziel, scheinbar aber auch welche die etwas besser sind<br />-Die Kanal- und BahnÄra scheinen auch geschichtlich gut zu passen.<br />-interessanter Markt-Mechanismus<br />-\"Brass: Birmingham\" unterscheidet sich mit \"Brass: Lancashire\" (vor langer Zeit als \"Kohle\" erschienen) u.A. durch das Bier und die speziellen Märkte. Man könnte es als erweiterte Edition zu Lanceshire/\"Kohle\" sehen.<br />-&gt; \"Kohle\" sah übrigens überhaupt nicht ansprechend aus. Die beiden \"Brass\"-Editionen dagegen sehr.<br /><br />Unbedingt nochmal, aber nicht für meine eigene Sammlung.<br /><br />(Ursprungs-Kommentar aus 02/2024:<br />Eine abgebrochene Partie, daher keine Bewertung.(nach erstem Zeitalter)<br />Es blieb mir im Gedächtnis, das es sehr interaktiv (fast schon aggressiv) ist.

The core mechanics of card management, movement, and battle do offer meaningful decisions.<br /><br />Update after 7 plays: I had hopes that the scenario themes, challenges, and variety of decisions would continue to increase with time. They haven't. I'm still having fun with great friends, but each scenario appears to be just a variant of \"kill all of the monsters in this dungeon\" every time. The minor flavor text at the beginning of each one are simply to figure out which fork of the path you choose, but then you just end up in a room killing all the monsters again. Still having fun, but I think I will tire of this before we get anywhere near playing them all.<br /><br />Most recent play Dec ‘19.",

The apparent epic volume of content in original Gloomhaven wasn't served by comparably epic writing as one would expect from such a long-running number one spot. JoTL had a more appropriate scale to the writing, I feel. Unlocking characters keeps this semi-engaging, but things don't develop as much as I would want or expect. I was expecting more from the writing, or perhaps less, so as to leave room for more imagination. The mechanics are a finely tuned machine, of course. To be fair, I am keen to play at least one session of Frosthaven to see what parts of the beast Isaac has sanded down, and which he's polished up.",

When I see this game ranked this high on BGG, I genuinely assume that the people rating it just don’t play RPG videogames. Even the Steam digital version of Gloomhaven blows playing in paper out of the water. If you’re rating this game really high purely for the videogame adaptation, then you’re not rating the board game. You’re rating the Videogame.",

I am addicted to this game! 50h+ in first 2 months!<br />I have a solo 2-character game and a 2-player 4-character game (online coop) going on at the same time. We also started a 4-player game and I am set to start another game with 2 players online. I have played the game at easy and sometimes I had a hard time collecting all the gold. Then I tried normal difficulty and we are just having trouble surviving! All 5 games at normal difficulty have ended up with us winning in the last 1-2 rounds before we would have lost. The card play and progression between missions is fantastic. Real headache (the good one) for deciding what items to buy, which enhancements/perks/cards to get.<br />I know I would never play the physical game because of setup time, upkeep and difficulty of gathering interested players often enough. The digital version solves all those problems for me.<br /><br />April 2021 update:<br />Still just fantastic. We have a group of 4 people who play online every Friday night since September 2020. We win most scenarios (95%) at normal difficulty, and rather rarely on the last 1-2 turns. We could increase difficulty to hard if we want more of a challenge but the game is still fun to play at normal. I played solo a bit with new characters after raising my 2-character party to level 9, but I am not that interested in it anymore (and I don't have much time). Playing multiplayer online is just so much more satisfying.<br /><br />January 2022 update:<br />We had not played since June because some of us had started to meet in person and we wanted a break after all those plays. We started the real campaign in November (now that it's available), and with COVID lockdown through the winter we are now back to playing 2 scenarios every week. I really love the new scenarios, including lots of bosses."

For the longest time i kept getting sponsors, no animals.<br /><br />This one is a really hard game to rate.  On one hand the game really is just draw until you find a win-con, on the hand theres a sort jazz-improv approaching to forming an engine to this game.  That ponzi scheme zoo i won with?:  it started as a European Fish zoo, had the sponsors for it an everything.  Then i didnt draw a single European animals the rest of the game, nor was there any in the display (think shop kinda).  I had to switch to trying win off of small animals, then small herbivores.  Again, on one hand i can attribute my win to 2-3 cards i just happened to draw, but also i drew A LOT and A LOT of it was just not usable for me.  That also said, a lot of the cards I passed up on were gaming winning in their own right.  It reminds of Slay the Spire in that i have no idea what I am going for at first, then i find something good, then I just spec into that hard and hope it works out, and frankly in this context I get why this game is so highly rated, BUT unlike Slay the Spire I cant play this game in under 1 hour XD AND much like Slay the Spire if you somehow dont lean into a strategy fast enough it can get bad, BUT you can in a very controlled manner buff the hell out of your draws (in burst, basically look up the action selection system, i like it a lot, and more cards played into it that i wouldve though).  So basically if you chill out and everyone is lax, the game is pretty fun, but if you want serious eurogaming or loooove 4x and refuse to settle for less this isnt for you.  <br /><br />I dont want to get into the gameplay too much because this game is on the line of being heavyweight, and my thoughts on the nature of this games strategy is long enough, so basically: action system your action cards are basically assigned a random slot/level/power (higher power=do more/better stuff with the card), Use a card and the lower slots level up and the card you use goes back to slot/level/power 1.  Again, i like this, theres a lot of decision space in this already, and again theres cards that mess with this a bit.   Also you can perma upgrade some of these cards.  The zoo itself has a Feast of Odin/Isle of Cats tile laying thing going on, as do scoring cards in addition to set collection.  End of game add conservation points from cards that have endgame scoring (i had like 3ish, and again i had way more sponsor cards than everyone else who had like 1 maybe 2 endgame scoring cards).  Based on your conservation points you get a target number (smaller is better for target number, and its written on the board).  Appeal (you get a lot of these, every animal you play gives appeal as do other cards) minus Target number = vp.  This took us like 45 seconds to calculate, one of my friends and I were stunned.  We had out calculators out, we were ready to spend 10 minutes calculating 8x different factors.  Nope, find target number, subtract that from appeal bingo bango done.  On one hand this is REALLY anticlimatic, but again, i chillaxed, because that calculation is craaaazy slick, i am honestly adding points for this.  Also because this game is too random, this game doesnt have a tight amount of actions/turns, and i like that in heavier games a lot.<br /><br />Quick opinion on expansion: its nice, nothing feels op, zero problem learning this first play.  I didnt realize for balance reasons it removes cards from the base game.  I have since shuffled all the cards into a pile (not a deck, pile).  Oops<br /><br />I have one solid issue with this game:  the icons on cards are EGREGIOUS.  50%-75% are to signify text THATS ALREADY ON THE CARD, text mind you, is concise and explains it perfecftly, the icons are ALL OVER THE CARD its bad and distracting XD.  With this many icons i genuinely think you need 4x quick references, not 1x<br /><br />So back to my predicament, this game is way too chill for its weight (i say its like 3 - 3.25 in weight imo).  Again, thats a good thing and a bad thing which is why this game is SO hard to rate for  me.  Its somewhere between an 8 and a 9  for me for sure, because, again, great game, but too random bullshit go.  I ll give a few extra points because for whatever reason this game is ALWAYS on sale.  I am sure this has popped up on prime days, nerdz days, and at time of writing i am sure it will go on a publisher wide sale two more times this year time of writing.  Its not even that expensive (i wish it was like $10 less on MSRP tbh).  8.75 is the score i can give that gives me the least amount of conflict.  <br /><br />10 - Perfect<br /> 9 - Perfect, but I wish it was a little more exciting, possibly missing an x-factor<br /> 8 - Pretty darn good, get it if you can afford it, maybe some gripes<br /> 7 - Pretty good, would recommend getting if it is on sale<br /> 6 - It's fine, maybe get if there's a heavy sale<br /> 5 - Little boring, the game is functional though, wouldnt recommend buying<br /> 4 - Is technically a game<br /> 3 - The so-bad-its-good movie of board games<br /> 2 - Somehow even worse<br /> 1 - Purely hypothetical, unimaginably bad",

                "Extremely replayable game. Terraforning mars + Castles of burgandy meets Zoo zycoon.",
                "The hype was real with this game. I rarely play solo games, so that's a pretty big deal. At the time of writing this, I've played Ark Nova 11 times in one week. Helps that I am on Christmas vacation, but I haven't played a game solo with this much fervor since Spirit Island. In fact, I think Ark Nova is the best game I've played since Spirit Island. Since I'm talking about the solo mode, I might as well just keep talking about it. It's super simple: take so many actions and then do a break phase. After so many actions, the game is just over. The ease of the solo mode reminds me a lot of Terraforming Mars. There are other comparisons to Terraforming Mars, which I'll address later. Like Spirit Island, there are a lot of ways to tweak the difficulty: start with 20, 10, or 0 appeal on any particular map. Then you have basically 3 different difficulties of maps: Map A (easy), Map 0 (medium), and Unique Maps 1-8 (hard). So, basically 9 levels of difficulty. You could also create other levels of difficulty by adjusting the appeal however you want.<br /><br />So, what is Ark Nova? Well, it's a tile laying game with many cards that are all unique, with various tags, and range in price fairly significantly. You try to compete for the best goals with your opponents. Additionally, you will get more money periodically throughout the game. Sounds like Terraforming Mars. Right? Well, yes. Though, it's a different game. Terraforming Mars is an engine building game, where players directly and indirectly interact with one another through actions and on a shared board. In Terraforming Mars, players manage 6 main resources and sometimes other resources as well. Ark Nova is different. Ark Nova has less player interaction (especially with the carebear variant), players place tiles on their own individual boards, and have less resources to manage. I think Terraforming Mars is nominally about building and leveraging the best resource engine. Terraforming Mars feels transactional. Ark Nova, by comparison, feels much more like a puzzle. The cards in Ark Nova typically aren't just \"pay money\" get resources. In Ark Nova, almost all the cards have requirements. Some of those are action requirements and some of those are personal board state requirements. In Terraforming Mars, actions are typically pay money get VP or resources. While you have to spend money wisely, it doesn't feel difficult. The action queue of what to use and upgrade in Ark Nova is an efficiency puzzle of its own. While many people compare these games, they feel different.<br /><br />It amazes me that a game that has taken disparate elements from various games: various things from Terraforming Mars, two track meetup from Rajas of the Ganges, and the action queue of Civilization New Dawn and it works. Not only does it work, it is amazing and it feels very different than many other games that I've played. If you like heavier euros, you need to play this game. Given BGG's preferences, I suspect this will end up in the BGG top 20 or higher. Well done Mathias Wigge!!<br /><br />Edit: After more games and more time playing it, I can say I dislike the money chits and the advanced boards don't feel balanced, unfortunately. This was listed as previously owned as I was trying to reduce my collection, so I sold it. That said, thoughts of the game kept coming back into my head and I decided to reacquire when the Marine Worlds expansion was released and I also printed the unique player power boards so maps could change between play but players could use the same maps for a better balanced game. Though, if both have the same objectives due to the map constraints, maybe luck will play more of a factor/be less interesting. I will likely report back at some point.",
                "Fun mechanisms, but it goes a bit long. The end game scoring is more confusing than it should be in my opinion. I like the engine building and set collection aspects of it along with the interesting action selection mechanism. Shared card market and claimable public goals with diminishing returns provide some interaction to what would otherwise be a solitaire game. I would probably choose Earth, Terraforming Mars, or Underwater Cities over this one on a heavier game night, but I'm happy to own it and it may grow on me over time.",

                "I will start by saying this is one of the most Epic feeling games you will play, ever. In a 6 player match, where everyone already knows how to play, it still took us 10 full hours to play and took over every inch of a 6 foot x 3.5 foot table. Ironically what makes it so epic is also it's biggest flaw because the complexity and investment of time and effort in coordinating an all day event to play this game is quite daunting. I have played both the 3rd edition and the 4th and I have to say that the improvements made in the 4th edition are phenomenal and greatly improved on some of the major flaws inherent in the 3rd edition. Notably the way the technology works has been streamlined and improved, the components and art have been ever so slightly improved, the functions of the strategy cards have been tweaked and balanced better, the political voting has been incorporated into a new agenda phase, the player boards are much improved and easier to understand and keep track of upgrades, and even the box is a better storage solution. Overall, every single flaw that plagued the 3rd edition has been tweaked, streamlined, and fixed for this far superior 4th edition, in my opinion. If I was to name any one aspect that I still think is a negative about this game it's that it can be difficult to come back if one player gets off to a bad start. It's possible to eliminate a player either completely or make them essentially irrelevant and still have hours of the game left to play which can take some of the enjoyment out for that player considering such a long game. This is a game that everyone in this hobby of board gaming has to at least experience once. If and when you do, take the time to do the leg work ahead of time by giving everyone rules, and materials ahead of time to prepare and plan out a full day with food and snacks. Then get ready for a wild ride of battles and negotiations.",

Almost death by boredom, saved by a more heated finale.<br /><br />Overall I see the potential of this game but find it quite overrated. It's core mechanics are somewhat incongruent mumbo-jumbo of good and bad/very dated concepts. While strategies and command tokens are fun and rewarding concept, component actions mostly encourage stalling, tech tree is bland, agenda is poorly designed and fiddly and random draw objectives is just a bad concept. You never feel really in control, just constantly jockeying for goals that are thrust on you and do not feel very immersive.<br /><br />EDIT: After another play i am lowering the rating to 5.5. It just doesn't feel justified to spend 10 hours playing this when there aren't that many meaningful decisions and instead of playing space opera you are bogged down in negotiating weird deals with your neighbors where you \"borrow\" a planet from someone in order to get your objective (politely allowing them to get their ass off beforehand). When I look at John Company with fun parliament phase, when I look at COIN games with asymmetric win goals and interesting areas of cooperation between factions then it gets harder and harder for me to justify bland and half-baked mechanics of TI that are somehow hyped as an ultimate boardgaming experience."

More than good. <br /><br />What sets it apart seems to be, making choices on what projects you could do is cheap, but which projects you actually commit to requires work. This does two notable things, First it moves some of the analysis paralysis inherent to complex games into your downtime rather than your turn. So you can actually think a bit in the context of not feeling as much pressure of others waiting for you to act. Second it means you tend to not feel on any given turn that sense of turn stuckness endemic to games that path foresight learned from path dependent game knowledge elide [1]. You can always take on a new project or make incremental progress on one you have. And so, 'it will click on the fourth game', is not a problem Terraforming Mars presents its players or its teachers. Instead you'll get better at the game, rather than converge on a baseline adequacy needed to get better. Unsurprisingly—yet massively understated—these make the Terraforming Mars experience feel good. Quite good. From the point of view of player, and especially new player, engagement, that's a brilliant design achievement. Terraforming Mars deserves immense credit for opening up an expanse where newer gamers can access complexity with ease, and experienced gamers can access ease with complexity. <br /><br />----<br />[1] See also, the \"you can't possibly judge a game on its first play\" trope.<br /><br />2021",

The scale of this game and the story it tells are amazing. Yes, it has a significant luck factor and there's a ton of dice chucking, but War of the Ring somehow manages to make it fun. Everything just works as it's glued together by this fantastic theme - chaos and randomness are just a part of the narrative.   <br /><br />I've painted all the minis in their respective nation colours, added custom-made card holders and a black leather bag for the hunt tokens and upgraded all six-sided dice. It really facilitated and improved the whole gameplay. I've also painted the custom made 3D model of Mount Doom to further enhance the look of the board. <br /><br /><b>/update, March 2019:</b> Don't listen to people who say that this game is terrible with 4 players, we had a TOTAL BLAST playing it in teams. It's a different experience, but really wonderful - sharing all your highs and lows with a teammate is something you can't experience in a 2-player game. The only thing I'm not sure I like yet is the fact that one of the winning allies \"wins more\" - this may cause some weird \"semi-cooperative\" instances (\"my ally has more points so I will play selfishly to beat him, which may cost us the game\" type of a thing). We just split the victory 50/50 and it felt great. Still, rivalry within factions is an appropriate thematic touch so maybe the final scoring part will grow on me.<br /><br /><i>I own the following expansions: Lords of Middle-earth, Kings of Middle-earth, The Fate of Erebor, Treebeard mini-expansion, The Seeing Stones mini-expansion.</i>",

                "Sprit Island is a pretty heavy-euro asymmetrical cooperative game where you're controlling spirits trying to protect an island from colonial invaders. The game is pretty infamous for being heavy but if you're experienced with a decent amount of medium-weight games then it's honestly not that bad to transition into it. I would never recommend someone that's not experienced with boardgames to play this one because there is just too much going on here.<br /><br /><br />This game is very prone to analysis paralysis and it's a very thinky game: which growth do I take? Do I spread presence or should I reclaim my cards? If I spread presence, should I beef up my energy or cards track? Where should I spread my presence? Which cards should I use? Which space should I focus on saving? And then once you make all those decisions, you think you have a good plan and then realize you can't actually achieve it because you don't have sacred sites where you need them or your abilities would be triggered slow. While the objectives are pretty straightforward there's just a lot of them in there. With all of that said, this can be a good or bad thing depending on the person that's playing this game. It's funny that my wife and I played this game very close to release and enjoyed it, played it again years later and were both incredibly confused on how to play this game, then we played it again years later and we enjoyed it again. Your decisions and the order in which you execute them matter so much in this game. There isn't always obvious choices to make. To me I think these are signs of an incredibly well designed game. While this game requires a lot of effort to get familiar with, I think it's worth trying if you enjoy euro-style games and you want something a little heavier and punishing.<br /><br />The game is aesthetically pleasing. The artwork is nice and the boards and cards are very high quality. With that said though some tracking of the game feels a little too loosely tracked, like orienting Dahan or towns / cities to display health or tracking which powers are in play and what kind of modifiers they may have. There's a lot going on in this game and it's easy to lose sight of some things! I do feel like the way the game is physically designed could have mitigated some of these issues (for example printing health on pieces to display health on certain sides / adding ability modifier reminder tokens / adding elemental track lines). This is definitely one of those games that the more you get familiar with it, the more I think you'll enjoy it. You'll most likely learn something new about it every time you play it.<br /><br />All the spirits play very differently so mixing and matching spirits seems like a way to get a lot out of the game's replayability. Overall my wife and I enjoyed this game quite a bit and we're excited to keep on playing it.",

Getting all the parts of your engine running is tough, and you have to work with what the card market presents to you. This creates an engaging pressure that means you have to make every move with intent and keep looking over your shoulders. The expressiveness of the design without any map is impreesive.<br /><br />I’ve only played this digitally though I am keen to try it on the table at least once.

                "This is a card driven civilization game where players use a limited supply of action tokens to take cards and add them to their tableaus or spend them on cards in their tableaus to activate those cards. What you are essentially doing is trying to move your markers up on various tracks in relationship to other players. Then event cards reward you or punish you for your relative position. The most crucial track is the raw points income track. I found cards that give significant improvements on this track to be somewhat rare, and hard to construct when you did get them. Most of these cards require a lot of stone, which is a resource another type of building produces.<br /><br />My second play of this game took about 5.5 hours plus about an hour of rules with 2 players. In that play, I would up missing the 2 stone production building. I wasn’t worried, thinking I would grab the 3 stone building when it finally hit the conveyor belt of cards but due to the random element inherent in a card driven game, the 3 stone card didn’t come out until late into the pile, and despite having a ton of 1 stone production buildings, I fell impossibly behind my opponent in points income. To compensate, I pushed into Military, thinking that If I could hit my opponent with the negative effects of the events it would provide me a catch-up opportunity, but the game has a very odd mechanism for military. You get a separate, much smaller budget of action markers for recruiting military units, and spending to play military event cards. Additionally at the end of your turn, you draw new cards from the event deck equal to the number of unused military actions you have. This meant that I was spending my military actions to build up forces, and my opponent meanwhile was able to fill his hand with either high scoring non-military events he could seed into the events deck, or high value defense cards he could use to counter my aggression and war cards. The result was a lot of failed actions and frustration on my part, as I led on the military track through the entire game, but in 6 hours only got the benefits of hitting my opponent once. My opponent said that by not spending his military actions he also was drawing enough cards that he saw a lot of cards that would have been powerful for me go by and he was able to just discard them. Luck of the draw here also didn’t help me, as I often times would only draw peaceful events and I didn’t much to help my strategy.<br /><br />I enjoyed a lot of the process of this game. I liked the way the cubes moved around the board meaning different things in different places. I liked the card drafting mechanism. I enjoyed the theme. The game also reminded me of a lot of games I’ve really loved in the past, however the downtime between turns is extremely long, and for the overall length of the game I’m not thrilled with the luck driven elements. ",
                "Played this recently one time. It is solid, not THAT hard to understand, although there are some confusing small rules, and ofcourse i sucked big time, because i was more busy remembering stuff and trying some things out instead of being really competitive. This game does MANY things good! I love the many tactics, mechanics which seem to work together effortly, and also really cool is the giant timeline in which you really have the feeling to go \" through the ages\" . Just like in Twilight Struggle, you are not playing a \" race\"  or a \" player\" but you are some overlord watching down as the years go by, tactically influencing events and leaders by playing cards, something i really like. <br /><br />The only pure negative for me is the timeframe. 3 hours is really long BUT... its 3 hours well spend(to be fair, Twilight Struggle mostly lasts just as long as does chess) and what it really does well is that feeling of progression to keep stuff interesting. Nothing feels more dragging as doing the same stuff in turn 1 as you do in turn 3939 (i am looking at you, Village..) . <br /><br />Overal, verdict: want to play again and some more after that! Well done"

                "Fun game. Works well with 2p. The game is a tad dry, but developing and expanding the territory of one's kingdom works well enough thematically. The game play is smooth and, for the most part, intuitive. There are multiple paths to score, but completing sets of areas in one's tableau will most likely yield the most points. There is a degree of randomness that can be mitigated, but it also adds an element of fun that we like. I have red/green color blindness, but I don't have any major trouble here.

                "Played it around fifteen times, mainly with three players, sometimes four players. The tile placement mechanism combined with dice roles and the scarcity of some of the more valuable tiles create a lot of tension and fierce competition among the players. At the same time you can choose different paths to victory in case another player is constantly grabbing the tiles you need, like trying to maintain the starting position in each round or to earn a lot of silver coins to buy additional tiles. The second best tile placement game I have played so far, after A Feast for Odin, and also compared with World Wonders and Planet Unknown. However, I am not a big fan of tile placement games in general, since most appear quite abstract and less thematic than other kinds of games. Furthermore, in Castles of Burgundy, you have to rearrange the whole setup four times during the game, which reduces the fun factor a little bit.<br /><br />Update: Changed my rating from 7 to 8 after having played CoB on BGA. Without the effort to set up the tiles again after each round, the game is much more enjoyable.",

The essence of this efficiency puzzle is managing the risk of an adverse dice roll not only through the use of workers but also by managing your player board in such a way as to ensure maximum optionality. There's nothing worse than rolling doubles of a die result that's far from the number you need, at the end of a phase when you don't have workers and there are few tiles remaining to pull from the central board and/or you are desperate to place a particular tile on your player board. At its core, this is a push-your-luck game and mitigating a lack of luck is crucial to avoid a frustrating game experience. While solid at all player counts (including GameRulesforOne's SoloPlay version, which is very good), CoB is best played with 4, since not all tiles become available at lower player counts. It can be very deflating to pursue a particular strategy that depends on acquiring specific tiles when those tiles never enter the game. While it can feel like multi-player solitaire at times, you need to be acutely aware of what other players are doing on their player boards. Player tension is also created by the fact that end-game points can be decisive no matter how far behind you fall on the points track.",

I wish card draw was more feasible and more rewarding. I'm always disappointed by card games that don't let you play cards. It's also a bit too abstracted for my taste since resources can convert to other resources and cards are multi-use. It just makes it feel a bit too mechanical. But the choices are plentiful and there's a decent amount of player interaction.",

Takes much more time to master than Dune Imperium in my  opinion. Currently a lot of fun to play but still a little bit overwhelmed in a fast game. Will update after another couple of plays.",

But after few plays I understood that yes, these are the same mechanics of many other games, but arranged in a brilliant way. The deck building is there, but with a minimalist approach. Why to use dozens of cards, when you can do a great deck building with a deck of 5-10 cards? The worker placement is also there, but it's dynamic and very thematic. The tech track is there, but also better then other games and very thematic. And all these common mechanics (deck building, worker placement, resource management, instant actions and tech track) work wonderfully in concert, with a perfect match with the theme and offering a deep and long living game experiece",

                "This game is overly complicated in that special Vital way, but the parts fit together  a little more cohesively than previous games. That's not to say that this game couldn't use a little streamlining, but I guess if you are into Vital's style of game this is probably your bag. It took me 3/4ths of the way through my first game before I started really understanding the flow and consequences of the different action options.<br /><br />The game flow is pretty nice. There are a dizzying number of options to do on your turn, but ultimately it comes down to play a card, then do 2 things based on the card you played and where you played it to. The graphic design helps and hurts in different ways. When you need to do something, there's usually an indicator reminding you to do it, however, the board layout and artwork is disorientingly busy. The icons are very small, and the numbers to look up what the icons mean are even smaller. This is also a game where you can expect to still be looking up what icons do even deep into the game, as some icons are used to mean two different things depending on the context of their appearance, and other icons are used only once and then never again.<br /><br />The player interaction in this game is more about predicting your opponents and trying to piggy back their moves more than it is about actually being able to do much to get in their way and hurt their scores. There are some surprising but minor luck elements of the game such as the order in which endgame scoring cards come out onto the display, and the tokens you start with.<br /><br />Generally I like the experience of this game. Playing it does wear me out however, whereas a really solid medium euro will energize me. ",

                "10x10 2017. Quite a good coop programming game.  Coop games can fall a little flat for me when they're to dry and puzzley.  This game avoids that with the frenetic programming.  You plan together but then you end up just having to do your best with the cards that come out.  The timer helps with this too.  Otherwise it would be possible for this game to be an AP nightmare.  As it is it's almost the opposite, trending a little more towards chaos.  The different mission provide a lot of variety.  Currently we're stuck at around the second to last mission.  And of course the production values are completely through the roof- it looks like it should cost twice as much as it does.  Ended up feeling kind of done with it with my group which is why I sold it.",
                "This game is excellent! Fully expect rating on this game to go up even more once we are finished with the campaign. The game is a programming game but you also have lots of options such as which way to turn, how many spaces to move, whether to tow or not, which card to draft, where to place the card, etc. It takes coordination with the teammates to determine who is going to try and do what and which actions people need to accomplish that strategy. The damage system is cool and there is so much more we have not even seen yet. Can't wait to keep going to the next missions!",
                "Scenario Game.<br />",
                "We worked our way through all the missions of Mechs vs. Minions.  The game starts with a lot of verve, and we fell in love with it.  Eventually the game started to feel repetitive.  But I still like Mechs vs. Minions.  As cooperative games go, this is one of the better ones.",
                "This is an incredibly fun fully co-op game. Each player gets an action board with 6 empty slots for cards. Each round you get a card and place it into one of the slots. The card has a type of movement on it, and an effect. If you place a card on top of a card of the same type, the effect of the top card is amplified. Then you resolve your slots from 1-6 and your figure on the board walks around mashing monsters in the way you programed it to do. Then the monsters get to move and attack. Taking damage means you flip cards that will mess up your programing in some way. Sometimes they cover an action slot, sometimes they swap action slots, sometimes they cause an ongoing effect to happen. You can repair damage by discarding a card during the draft rather than program it. The combat is completely diceless, which is fantastic. For a game with this much pageantry, there is surprisingly little randomness. The level ends when you complete or fail your objective, which varies scenario to scenario. <br /><br />Another fantastic element is that the game doesn't have a steep learning curve, as of the cards you draft, there are only 8 different cards, 2 of each color. It really allows you to focus in on the fun puzzle of figuring out how and where you will move and attack on your turn.",
                "Very nice chaotic cooperative campaign game. Not sure about its replayability.",
                "9",
                "All in all, I like Mechs vs Minions. It's clever in what it does while having quite straightforward rules at the same time. And despite having a substantial amount of built-in randomness, it is controllable to a degree and it still offers a good programming puzzle that is strategic and satisfactory when you execute it right. <br /><br />Also, the production value of this game is off the charts. The box is huge, and there is a TON of good-quality plastic (some of which is even pre-painted) and even some metal components, the cards are good quality and the cardboard elements are thick and sturdy. The only minor complaint I may have is that the shiny fragments of map tiles are unfortunately catching scratches quite easily. But overall, the game feels very premium.<br /><br />However, the scenarios are quite uneven. Some are very good, some are just good/ok, and there are also a few that feel unbalanced and not very well-thought.<br /><br />To sum up - a well-designed game that I enjoy most of the time, but which also sometimes has its worse moments.",
                "Solid co-op. The miniatures are top notch. The box is massive. The pre planned movement can get very frustrating if planned incorrectly early. I can see why some would not enjoy it as long term planning is a must and taking a single point of damage throws off your entire plan. That being said, it's fun and enjoyable. There really is no theme and I don't feel like I'm playing League of Legends in the least bit so you won't need to play LoL to enjoy this. On the flip side, if you are looking for a game that captures the League theme, this isn't it.",

Skullport and Undermountain add interesting and powerful location to the board, usually shaping the course of the game or at least influencing plays. Corruption, however, is the best mechanic, adding powerful but costly options. 6th player game can be too long.",

I always felt like I had a strategy yet this was simple enough in concept that it was definitely not a heavy game. I had low expectations for some reason despite the positive hype this game gets but I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoy the idea about the harbor giving you a free re-deploy action as well as the ability to create buildings that you own and get bonuses for when others go there. Definitely play with expansions though, if you can. This game is neat in that it has so many choices that you really want to do but you cannot do them all. Definitely exceeded my expectations.",

If you're not, I would play with no more than 3 players. High player counts causes the game to take longer and reduces the number of agents each player gets. 3-4 agents per player (before round 5) feels like the sweet spot.",

My wife finds it way too long (our 2-player games take 2-2.5h) and it melts her brain. She has too many possibilities during her turn and she doesn't know what she should do. I love planning 2-3 turns in advance and seeing my plan come through, it's super satisfying. If it were easier to hit the table it would probably be a 10 for me.<br /><br />Played a first 3 player game and it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Played at 6 players with 4 new players and that was a bad idea, even with shortened game length.<br /><br />Currently playing express version with my wife and she loves it. We play with less houses and less cards and can get it done in 1h (excluding setup).",

But has really nice mechanics, a good amount of player interaction, and a clever, slightly-orthogonal way of scoring. 9.<br /><br />7/29/24: After a few more plays, it seems like the game takes 30 minutes longer than it needs to. And I can’t shake the feeling that the game feels a little boring. But that could just be lack of familiarity. 8.",

                "A unique take of dudes-on-a-map that rewards sneaky, tactical, negotiation decision making over crushing your enemies. It's like if you take the area majority, card based action system (kinda), and mechanical elegance of El Grande, combine it with the table-talk negotiation, leader-bashing conflict, and the tactical \"how do I make the best use of my hand\" nature of Cole Wehrle games (especially like Arcs), and then add a beautiful production with classic Celtic art. In other words, an absolute masterpiece of a game. <br /><br />I like this game even better than both of the aforementioned games though for a few reasons. First, this game scales to any available player count with grace. At 2 player, the game feels a lot like high level chess: cutthroat, strategic, low rules overhead, and near-perfect information, but with no real chance of losing because you didn't know an opening. At 3-4 player (and 5 with the Seasons expansion), the game becomes a lot more negotiation heavy with a lot of compromises and plenty of tension. Nothing like Root or El Grande where playing at the non-optimal player counts just feels worse if not awful. <br /><br />The second big reason I like this game more is because it is easy to both get to the table and teach. I've had plenty of success teaching even some non-gamers this game and even if they don't immediately get all of the game's subtleties, they still usually have fun engaging with the game. There is plenty of room to claw towards a victory condition, even if you get bullied early on or you aren't exactly sure what to do. But when you do get this game, the layers of depth and mind games are exquisite. The art being fantastic is also a big plus. <br /><br />The third and final reason is that there aren't any mechanics that I don't have any hiccups on. No weird memory-ish mechanic like the tower in El Grande, and no turn-wasting luck of the dice combat like Root or Arcs. Definitely the smallest point but certainly not an insignificant one. <br /><br />When it comes to cons, this game can theoretically go on forever, but I've never found that to happen as players figured out the game more and become sneakier with their wins (hint: use deeds), and if it's really a problem then the expansion solves it with a new rule that you can easily print out on a piece of paper for reference while playing the base game. <br /><br />Besides that, of course not everyone will enjoy the high player conflict present in this game. You have to be ready to constantly face confrontation. This game also has a literal Uno-style mechanic in it where you wave a giant flag that you are about to win, so a big part of the game is figuring out how to win while being subtle about it so you don't end up playing a bash-the-leader loop all game, so you can’t be asleep at the wheel and have to really invest to get the most out of this game.  Again, not everyone's taste. <br /><br />In summary, this is easily my favorite game of all time because it combines all the things I love: relative mechanical simplicity, high player interaction both social and combative, plenty of depth, great production,and ability to play with a wide variety of groups.

The theme and promise of a short, highly interactive game lured me in.<br /><br />The main takeaway is that you don't play the game as much as you play the other players. There are no points (you win by fulfilling a condition), and anyone can attack anyone, so the focus is on encouraging other players to stop each other so you can slip through and win on your turn. Moreover, the game includes a frustrating mechanic: the option to cancel someone else's turn, stopping their whole plan for the round. The next round, the card returns, and anyone can use it to ruin the same player's round again. Additionally, there are random Epic Tale cards that can do anything from removing other clans to ending clashes immediately.<br /><br />The result is randomness and total chaos. It can be enjoyable if you embrace the randomness and fast playstyle, but if one player multitasks or suffers from analysis paralysis, it quickly becomes dull because there isn't much to consider once you've selected your four action cards.<br /><br />The components are a mixed bag. I like the theme and art, and the map tiles and cards are high quality. However, the miniatures have mostly bent weapons, and the cards are far too oversized to be comfortable.",

                "Gorgeous aesthetic and has the good feel of shallow rules & deep decisions.  Might be my favorite implementation of drafting as a core mechanic in a game, and the fact that the actions that are available to you (and your opponents) each turn are totally dependent on the card draft make this a unique entry in the area control genre.  This game has the potential to be great, but the unpredictable game length makes it hard to get to the table and the high potential for king-making detracts from the strategic satisfaction a bit.",
